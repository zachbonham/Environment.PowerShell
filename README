In our development environment, we provision all of our servers with a configuration value in the machine.config which applications can use to determine what configuration value to use.  

This is highly specific to our development environment and not likely to have value elsewhere other than a rough example of a PowerShell Module.

There are a couple of different ways to deploy Environment.PowerShell.dll module:

- copy to %PSModulePath%\Environment.PowerShell\Environment.PowerShell.dll
- copy to some other known location

When running a PowerShell session, it might be necessary to import the module into the session.  To do this execute:

If module was copied to %PSModulePath%\Environment.PowerShell

import-module Environment.PowerShell

Otherwise provide the path to the location of the Environment.PowerShell.dll.  For example, if you copied to C:\modules:

import-module c:\modules\Environment.PowerShell

You must be an administrator to run this as Environment.PowerShell is writing appSettings values to the available machine.configs.
